    "reasonEn": "- <strong>Attributing Emotions to AI:</strong> AI models like me don't experience emotions such as \"unhappiness.\" Phrasing requests in terms of how an AI processes information (clarity, accuracy, potential issues, adherence to guidelines) is more effective.<br>\n- <strong>Specificity of Request:</strong> \"What's wrong\" can be a bit blunt. Asking about \"unclear points,\" \"problematic aspects,\" \"areas for improvement,\" or \"better phrasing\" provides more constructive avenues for feedback.<br>\n- <strong>Focus on Learning:</strong> Framing the request as a desire to learn (\"so I can learn from it\") often elicits more helpful and detailed responses.",
    "reasonZh": "- <strong>將情緒歸因於 AI：</strong> 像我這樣的 AI 模型不會經歷像「不高興」這樣的情緒。從 AI 如何處理資訊 (清晰度、準確性、潛在問題、遵守指南) 的角度來提出請求會更有效。<br>\n- <strong>請求的具體性：</strong> \"What's wrong\" (哪裡錯了) 可能有點生硬。詢問「不清楚的地方」、「可能有問題的方面」、「可以改進的領域」或「更好的措辭」為回饋提供了更具建設性的途徑。<br>\n- <strong>專注於學習：</strong> 將請求表達為學習的願望 (\"so I can learn from it\" / 這樣我才能從中學習) 通常會引出更有幫助和詳細的回應。",
