    "reasonEn": "<strong>\"Jealous to\":</strong> The correct preposition is \"jealous of.\"<br>\n<strong>\"Successful person\":</strong> Should be plural \"successful people\" if referring to them generally, or \"a successful person\" if singular.<br>\n<strong>Clarity of Request:</strong> \"teach me some thoughts\" is a bit abstract. \"Teach me some ways of thinking,\" \"share some perspectives,\" or \"give me some advice on how to think\" is clearer.<br>\n<strong>Flow:</strong> Connecting \"that maybe they are hot and they are successful\" can be smoother.",
    "reasonZh": "<strong>\"Jealous to\"：</strong> 正確的介係詞是 \"jealous of\" (嫉妒某人)。<br>\n<strong>\"Successful person\"：</strong> 若指一群人，應用複數 \"successful people\" (成功人士)；若指單一人，則用 \"a successful person\" (一個成功的人)。<br>\n<strong>請求的清晰度：</strong> \"teach me some thoughts\" (教我一些想法) 有點抽象，可以說 \"teach me some ways of thinking\" (教我一些思維方式)、\"share some perspectives\" (分享一些觀點) 或 \"give me some advice on how to think\" (給我一些如何思考的建議)，這樣更清晰。<br>\n<strong>流暢度：</strong> 連接 \"that maybe they are hot and they are successful\" (他們可能既性感又成功) 的部分可以更自然一些。",
