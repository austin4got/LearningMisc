    "originalSentence": "So what is the licensing mechanism? Because I saw the bottle...say, it's skin...that's what makes you say that recommend people have licensing when they are not full...like empty.",

        "I'm curious, why might glycine supplements be recommended for people who are feeling emotionally empty or unfulfilled?",

    ],
    "reasonEn": "<strong>Clarity over Fragmentation:</strong> The original attempts were very hard to understand due to fragmented sentences and incorrect vocabulary (\"licensing,\" \"skin\" in this context).<br>\n<strong>Precise Vocabulary:</strong> Using \"glycine supplements,\" \"recommended,\" \"emotionally empty,\" and \"unfulfilled\" makes the question clear and specific.<br>\n<strong>Direct Question Formation:</strong> Structuring it as a direct \"Why...\" or \"Could you explain why...\" question is effective.<br>\n<strong>Acknowledging User's Terminology:</strong> Phrases like \"when someone feels 'empty' or 'not full' emotionally\" can acknowledge the user's original way of describing the feeling while placing it in a clearer context.",
    "reasonZh": "<strong>從零碎到清晰：</strong> 最初的表達因為句子破碎和用詞不當 (如 \"licensing\"、以及在此情境下的 \"skin\") 而非常難以理解。<br>\n<strong>準確詞彙：</strong> 使用 \"glycine supplements\" (甘胺酸補充劑)、\"recommended\" (被推薦)、\"emotionally empty\" (情感空虛) 和 \"unfulfilled\" (不滿足) 使問題清晰具體。<br>\n<strong>直接問句：</strong> 構成直接的 \"Why...\" (為什麼...) 或 \"Could you explain why...\" (你能解釋為什麼...) 的問句很有效。<br>\n<strong>關照使用者用語：</strong> 像 \"when someone feels 'empty' or 'not full' emotionally\" (當某些人感覺情感上「空虛」或「不滿足」時) 這樣的片語，可以在更清晰的語境中認可使用者最初描述感受的方式。",

        "Self-Correction Tip (自我修正提示):",
        "English: When you're unsure of a word (like \"licensing\" for glycine), it's okay to describe what you mean or ask, \"I'm not sure of the word, but it's a supplement for...\" This can help the listener understand better than using a potentially confusing incorrect word.",
        "中文：當你不確定某個詞 (例如用 \"licensing\" 代替 glycine) 時，可以描述你的意思，或者問「我不確定那個詞怎麼說，但它是一種用於...的補充劑」。這樣比使用一個可能造成混淆的錯誤詞語更能幫助聽者理解。"
