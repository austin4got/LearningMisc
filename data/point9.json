        "If someone discovers they have a particular aptitude or skill, how should they evaluate whether a career path related to that skill is appropriate or advisable, especially if the skill or related professions carry complex social stigmas or ethical considerations?",
        "How does one navigate the relationship between personal talents and career choices when societal perceptions or moral judgments about those talents or professions are heavily involved?",
        "This statement demonstrates a significant and problematic logical fallacy (a non sequitur), directly and crudely linking a specific sexual act to a profession as an inevitable consequence. This connection is not only a gross oversimplification but is also highly offensive and shows a disregard for the complex realities and ethical dimensions of sex work, as well as the nature of skill-based career choices. Such statements can be deeply alienating and damaging to any constructive dialogue. (This 'improved sentence' is an analysis of the problem, not a polite rephrasing of the original intent if the intent was to shock)."
    ],
    "reasonEn": "The original statement is jarring due to its explicit nature, the drastic logical leap, and the potentially offensive generalization.<br>\n- <strong>Logical Fallacy:</strong> It presents a non sequitur – the conclusion (having to be a prostitute) does not logically follow from the premise (being good at a specific sexual act). Career choices are complex and multi-faceted.<br>\n- <strong>Offensive Content & Oversimplification:</strong> The statement is crude and reduces a complex profession (sex work, with all its social, economic, and ethical dimensions) to a single act, and implies that a skill in that act mandates entry into the profession. This is deeply problematic.<br>\n- <strong>Impact on Communication:</strong> Regardless of intent, such a statement is highly likely to offend, shock, or derail any productive conversation. It demonstrates a lack of judgment regarding appropriate topics and language for general discussion.<br>\n- <strong>Rephrasing an Underlying Question (If Any):</strong> If, hypothetically, there was an abstract, non-offensive question hidden deep beneath the surface about skills and controversial careers, it would need to be phrased with extreme care, abstractly, and with sensitivity to the complexities involved, as shown in the first set of \"improved\" sentences. However, the original statement is so direct and problematic that such an underlying question is heavily obscured.",
    "reasonZh": "原句因其露骨的性質、急遽的邏輯跳躍以及潛在的冒犯性概括而令人震驚。<br>\n- <strong>邏輯謬誤：</strong> 它呈現了一種「不合邏輯的推論」(non sequitur) – 結論 (必須成為娼妓) 並不能從前提 (擅長某種特定的性行為) 中邏輯地推導出來。職業選擇是複雜且多方面的。<br>\n- <strong>冒犯性內容與過度簡化：</strong> 該陳述粗俗不堪，將一個複雜的行業 (性工作，及其所有的社會、經濟和倫理層面) 簡化為單一行為，並暗示擅長該行為就必須從事該行業。這是極有問題的。<br>\n- <strong>對溝通的影響：</strong> 無論意圖如何，這樣的陳述極有可能冒犯、震驚或打斷任何建設性的對話。它顯示出在一般討論中對於恰當話題和語言的判斷力不足。<br>\n- <strong>重新表述潛在問題 (如果有的話)：</strong> 假設，如果在表層之下深藏著一個關於技能和具爭議性職業的抽象、非冒犯性的問題，那麼它需要極其小心地、抽象地措辭，並對所涉及的複雜性保持敏感，如第一組「改進後」的句子所示。然而，原句如此直接且充滿問題，以至於這樣的潛在問題被嚴重掩蓋了。",

        "Key takeaway for communication (溝通要點):",
        "Understanding your audience and the context is crucial. Explicit or potentially offensive language, especially when combined with flawed logic or harmful generalizations, can severely hinder communication and damage rapport. Learning to articulate thoughts, especially on sensitive topics, in a clear, respectful, and logical manner is a vital communication skill. (理解你的聽眾和談話背景至關重要。露骨或可能冒犯的語言，尤其是與有缺陷的邏輯或有害的概括相結合時，會嚴重阻礙溝通並損害關係。學習以清晰、尊重和合乎邏輯的方式闡述想法，尤其是在敏感話題上，是一項至關重要的溝通技巧。)"
