    "improvedSentences": ["Okay, Chad, I have two questions for you, and I'll say them in Chinese. First, I want you to remember a rule: when I start speaking in English, please interpret my sentences based only on their literal meaning. If they don't form a logical sense, tell me directly that you don't quite understand what I'm saying. Then, you could perhaps propose another sentence in English and ask me if that's what I intended to say. This way, I can get feedback on which sentences aren't quite reasonable or don't sound natural in everyday conversation."],
