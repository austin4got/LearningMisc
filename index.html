                title_en: "1. Expressing ability or habit",
                originalSentence: "I don't know if I talk English to me.",
                improvedSentences: [
                    "I don't know if I can speak English well with you.",
                    "I'm not sure if I'm speaking English correctly with you.",
                    "I'm not sure if my English is good enough to talk with you.",
                    "I'm wondering about my English proficiency for this conversation."
                ],
                reasonEn: `The original sentence "I don't know if I talk English to me" contains a few issues.<br>
                            - <strong>"Talk English" vs. "Speak English":</strong> While "talk English" can be used in specific contexts (e.g., "Let's talk English now to practice"), "speak English" is generally used when referring to the ability or skill of using the English language. So, "I speak English" is standard for stating ability.<br>
                            - <strong>"to me":</strong> This part is confusing. It seems like a direct translation from a language where a reflexive pronoun might be used differently. In English, if you're speaking *to* someone, you'd say "speak English *to you*" or "speak English *with you*." If you're talking about your own internal monologue, that's different, but in a conversation, "to me" in this structure is incorrect.<br>
                            - <strong>Clarity of Intent:</strong> The sentence likely intends to express uncertainty about one's English speaking ability in the current conversation. The improved sentences offer clearer and more natural ways to convey this. "Can speak English well" focuses on the quality of communication. "Speaking English correctly" emphasizes grammatical accuracy. "My English is good enough" addresses the adequacy of language skills for the interaction. "Wondering about my English proficiency" is a slightly more formal way to express this doubt.`,
                reasonZh: `原句 "I don't know if I talk English to me" 有幾個問題。<br>
                            - <strong>"Talk English" vs. "Speak English"：</strong> 雖然 "talk English" 可以在特定情境下使用 (例如："Let's talk English now to practice" - 我們現在用英語交談來練習)，但當指稱使用英語的能力或技巧時，通常用 "speak English"。所以，"I speak English" (我會說英語) 是陳述能力的標準說法。<br>
                            - <strong>"to me"：</strong> 這部分令人困惑。它看起來像是從另一種語言直接翻譯過來的，該語言中反身代名詞的用法可能不同。在英語中，如果你是*對*某人說話，你會說 "speak English *to you*" (對你說英語) 或 "speak English *with you*" (和你用英語交談)。如果是指自言自語，那另當別論，但在對話中，"to me" 用在這裡是不正確的。<br>
                            - <strong>意圖清晰度：</strong> 這句話可能想表達在當前對話中對自己英語口說能力的不確定性。修改後的句子提供了更清晰、更自然的方式來傳達這一點。"Can speak English well" 強調溝通的品質。"Speaking English correctly" 強調文法的正確性。"My English is good enough" 則針對互動中語言技能的充分性。"Wondering about my English proficiency" 是一種稍微正式一點表達這種疑慮的方式。`,
                furtherExamples: [
                    "I'm still learning, so please let me know if I make any mistakes. (我還在學習，所以如果我犯了任何錯誤，請告訴我。)",
                    "Is my pronunciation clear enough? (我的發音夠清楚嗎？)",

                    "When you say there's \"significant room for discussion,\" what exactly are you referring to?"
                ],
                reasonEn: `The phrase "big room to discussion" is not standard English.<br>
                            - <strong>Idiom:</strong> The correct idiom is "room for discussion," which means there are aspects of a topic that can be debated, explored further, or are open to interpretation. Adding adjectives like "a lot of," "ample," "significant," or "little" modifies the extent of this openness.<br>
                            - <strong>Preposition:</strong> The preposition should be "for" ("room *for* discussion"), not "to." "For" indicates purpose or suitability (i.e., the topic is suitable *for* discussion). "To" often indicates direction or a recipient, which doesn't fit here.<br>
                            - <strong>Literal vs. Figurative:</strong> "Big room" literally refers to a large physical space. While "room" in "room for discussion" is also a spatial metaphor, the common collocations are with words like "ample" or "little," not typically "big" in this figurative sense.`,
                reasonZh: `片語 "big room to discussion" 不是標準英語。<br>
                            - <strong>慣用語：</strong> 正確的慣用語是 "room for discussion"，意思是某個主題的某些方面可以辯論、進一步探討，或者是開放解釋的。加上形容詞如 "a lot of" (很多)、"ample" (充裕的)、"significant" (顯著的) 或 "little" (很少) 可以修飾這種開放的程度。<br>
                            - <strong>介係詞：</strong> 介係詞應該是 "for" ("room *for* discussion")，而不是 "to"。"For" 表示目的或適合性 (即該主題適合討論)。"To" 通常表示方向或接收者，在此不適用。<br>
                            - <strong>字面與比喻義：</strong> "Big room" 字面上指一個大的實體空間。雖然 "room for discussion" 中的 "room" 也是一個空間隱喻，但在這個比喻義中，常見的搭配詞是像 "ample" 或 "little"，通常不是 "big"。`,
                furtherExamples: [
                    "The new proposal leaves little room for maneuver. (新提案幾乎沒有轉圜的餘地。)",

                    "We need to leave some wiggle room in the schedule. (我們需要在日程安排中留出一些彈性空間。)",
                    "That's a moot point/question. (那是一個沒有實際意義、無需爭論的點/問題。) - Used when further discussion is pointless."

                improvedSentences: [

                ],
                reasonEn: `While "I wonder how I should call you?" is grammatically understandable, it's a bit less direct and can sound slightly more hesitant than necessary for such a common question.<br>
                            - <strong>Directness:</strong> "What should I call you?" is the most straightforward and commonly used phrase.<br>
                            - <strong>Formality:</strong> "How should I address you?" is more formal and might be used in professional settings or when showing extra respect. "Address" here means "to use a particular name or title when speaking or writing to someone."<br>
                            - <strong>"I wonder...":</strong> Using "I wonder..." can soften a question, but for this specific query, it can make it sound a little overly contemplative. However, it's not strictly incorrect, just less common than the direct form.`,
                reasonZh: `雖然 "I wonder how I should call you?" 在文法上可以理解，但對於這樣一個常見的問題來說，它有點不夠直接，聽起來可能比必要的更猶豫。<br>
                            - <strong>直接性：</strong> "What should I call you?" 是最直接且最常用的說法。<br>
                            - <strong>正式度：</strong> "How should I address you?" 更為正式，可能用於專業場合或表示額外尊重時。"Address" 在這裡的意思是「在對某人說話或寫信時使用特定的名字或頭銜」。<br>
                            - <strong>"I wonder..."：</strong> 使用 "I wonder..." 可以使問題語氣更委婉，但對於這個特定的詢問，它可能聽起來有點過於沉思。然而，這並非完全錯誤，只是不如直接的形式常見。`,

                ],
                reasonEn: `- <strong>"Sentence" vs. "Expression/Phrase/Way to put it":</strong> When asking for alternative ways to say something, "expression" or "phrase" is usually more accurate than "sentence." You're looking for a specific lexical item or a short group of words, not necessarily a full grammatical sentence. "Way to put it" is also a good, natural alternative.<br>
                            - <strong>"To talk about being":</strong> This can often be simplified. Instead of "another sentence to talk about being too tired," you can say "another expression for being very tired" or "another way to say someone is very tired."<br>
                            - <strong>Specificity:</strong> "In a British way" is okay, but "in British English" is slightly more precise.`,
                reasonZh: `- <strong>"Sentence" vs. "Expression/Phrase/Way to put it"：</strong> 當詢問某事的其他說法時，"expression" (表達方式) 或 "phrase" (片語) 通常比 "sentence" (句子) 更準確。您尋找的是特定的詞彙項目或簡短的詞組，而不一定是完整的文法句子。"Way to put it" (說法) 也是一個很好、很自然的替代詞。<br>
                            - <strong>"To talk about being"：</strong> 這通常可以簡化。與其說 "another sentence to talk about being too tired"，不如說 "another expression for being very tired" (表示非常疲倦的另一種表達方式) 或 "another way to say someone is very tired" (說某人非常疲倦的另一種方式)。<br>
                            - <strong>具體性：</strong> "In a British way" (用英式的方式) 可以，但 "in British English" (在英式英語中) 稍微更精確。`,

                            - <strong>意圖 vs. 效果：</strong> "Derogatory" 主要描述所使用語言的*性質*或*意圖* – 它是一種表示不尊重或對某人某物評價很低的語言。感到「渺小和軟弱」是被這種語言攻擊的人可能產生的*效果*。<br>
